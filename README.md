1. It's a square wave, and as we increase the duty cycle, the on time increases and off time decreases.
2. The message is 51,0,(the voltage read by the analog pin).
3. 1348 microseconds.
4. 1804 microseconds
5. 140 microseconds.
6. 132 microseconds
7. Slappin' a printf statement in your code is easy but SLOW.
8. So they have the same reference voltage.
