1. It's a square wave, and as we increase the duty cycle, the on time increases and off time decreases.
2. The message is `"51,0,{the voltage read by the analog pin}\n"`.
3. 1348 µs.
4. 1804 µs
5. 140 µs.
6. 132 µs
7. Slappin' a `Serial.print` statement in your code is easy to do but is slow (can add about 500 µs per call).
8. So they have the same reference voltage.
